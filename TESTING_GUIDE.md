# MikroTik Cursor MCP - Testing Guide

**Version:** v4.8.0 (ENTERPRISE-COMPLETE)  
**Status:** Production-Ready  
**Coverage:** 99% RouterOS features (382 actions)

---

## 🛡️ **SAFETY FIRST!**

### Pre-Testing Checklist

Before testing any MikroTik MCP features:

✅ **Create Backup:** Always create a backup before testing
✅ **Test Environment:** Use a non-production router if possible  
✅ **Internet Connection:** Verify connectivity before and after  
✅ **Documentation:** Review feature documentation first

### How to Create and Restore Backups

```python
# Create backup before testing
mikrotik_backup(action="create_backup", name="pre-testing-backup")

# If something goes wrong, restore:
mikrotik_backup(action="restore_backup", backup_name="pre-testing-backup")
# Note: Router will reboot after restore
```

---

## 🔄 **Restart Cursor After Configuration Changes**

**When to restart Cursor:**
- After modifying `mcp.json` configuration
- After installing or updating the MCP server
- After changing environment variables

**How to restart:**
1. Close all Cursor windows
2. End Cursor process in Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac)
3. Reopen Cursor
4. Wait 10-15 seconds for MCP servers to initialize

## 🧪 **Testing MikroTik MCP Features**

### Phase 1: READ-ONLY Tests (100% Safe) ✅

These commands only READ data - they CANNOT break your router configuration:

```python
# Test 1: System Resources (safe - just reads status)
mikrotik_system(action="get_system_resources")
# Expected: CPU, RAM, disk usage, uptime

# Test 2: List Interfaces (safe - just reads config)
mikrotik_interfaces(action="list_interfaces")
# Expected: List of all network interfaces

# Test 3: List Backups (safe - just reads files)
mikrotik_backup(action="list_backups")
# Expected: List of backup files

# Test 4: List Firewall Rules (safe - just reads)
mikrotik_firewall(action="list_filter_rules")
# Expected: Current firewall filter rules

# Test 5: Get System Identity (safe - just reads)
mikrotik_system(action="get_system_identity")
# Expected: Router name/identity

# Test 6: List IP Addresses
mikrotik_ip(action="list_ip_addresses")
# Expected: All configured IP addresses

# Test 7: List Routes
mikrotik_routes(action="list_routes")
# Expected: Routing table

# Test 8: DNS Settings
mikrotik_dns(action="get_dns_settings")
# Expected: Current DNS configuration
```

**Safety Level:** 🟢 **100% Safe** - These only READ, never WRITE

---

### Phase 2: Safe Write Tests (Low Risk) ⚠️

These tests create new configuration but don't modify existing critical settings:

```python
# Test 1: Create backup (safe - doesn't change config)
mikrotik_backup(action="create_backup", name="test-backup")
# Verify: Check backup was created
mikrotik_backup(action="list_backups")

# Test 2: Add a test comment to existing rule (safe - just adds metadata)
# Note: Use with caution on production systems

# Test 3: Create a disabled firewall rule (safe - it's disabled)
mikrotik_firewall(
    action="create_filter_rule",
    chain="forward",
    rule_action="accept",
    comment="TEST RULE - SAFE TO DELETE",
    disabled=True
)
# Verify: Check rule was created (and is disabled)
mikrotik_firewall(action="list_filter_rules")
```

**Safety Level:** 🟡 **Low Risk** - Creates new items but doesn't modify existing config

---

### Phase 3: Integration Tests

For complete integration testing, see: `tests/integration/`

#### Running Integration Tests

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio

# Run all integration tests
pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/integration/test_mikrotik_user_integration.py -v

# Run with detailed output
pytest tests/integration/ -v -s
```

#### Test Coverage

- ✅ User management (create, list, update, remove)
- ✅ Firewall rules (filter, NAT, mangle)
- ✅ DHCP servers and pools
- ✅ DNS configuration
- ✅ IP addresses and routes
- ✅ Interface management
- ✅ System operations
- ✅ Backup and restore

## 📊 **Testing Checklist**

### Before Starting
- [ ] Backup created and verified
- [ ] Internet connectivity confirmed
- [ ] MCP server loaded in Cursor
- [ ] Documentation reviewed

### Phase 1 Tests (READ-ONLY)
- [ ] System resources test passed
- [ ] List interfaces test passed
- [ ] List backups test passed
- [ ] List firewall rules test passed
- [ ] Get system identity test passed
- [ ] Internet still working ✅

### Phase 2 Tests (WRITE)
- [ ] Backup creation test passed
- [ ] Test firewall rule created
- [ ] Test rule cleanup successful
- [ ] Internet still working ✅

### Integration Tests
- [ ] All pytest tests passed
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] Router functionality verified
- [ ] Internet still working ✅

---

## 🆘 **Emergency Recovery**

### If Internet Stops Working

**Option 1: Via Cursor/MCP**
```python
# Restore from backup
mikrotik_backup(action="restore_backup", backup_name="pre-testing-backup")
# Router will reboot to previous state
```

**Option 2: Via Winbox**
1. Open Winbox
2. Connect to router (192.168.88.1 or MAC address)
3. Go to System → Backup
4. Click "Restore" and select your backup
5. Router will reboot

**Option 3: Via SSH**
```bash
ssh admin@192.168.88.1
/system backup load name=pre-testing-backup
```

**Option 4: Physical Reset** (Last Resort)
1. Hold reset button for 5 seconds (soft reset)
2. Or hold reset button until LED turns off (hard reset - loses all config!)

## 🎓 **Best Practices**

1. **Always create backups** before testing write operations
2. **Start with read-only tests** to verify MCP connectivity
3. **Use test routers** when possible, not production
4. **Test incrementally** - one feature at a time
5. **Document everything** - what worked, what didn't
6. **Keep internet working** - verify after each test phase
7. **Clean up test data** - remove test rules, users, etc.
8. **Review logs** - check for warnings or errors
