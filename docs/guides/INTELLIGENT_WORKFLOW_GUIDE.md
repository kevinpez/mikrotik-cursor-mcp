## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Risk Assessment Engine**
```python
# Pattern-based risk classification
risk_patterns = {
    RiskLevel.LOW: [r'/ip\s+address\s+print', r'/interface\s+print', ...],
    RiskLevel.MEDIUM: [r'/ip\s+address\s+add', r'/user\s+add', ...],
    RiskLevel.HIGH: [r'/system\s+reboot', r'/interface\s+bridge\s+add', ...],
    RiskLevel.CRITICAL: [r'/system\s+reset-configuration', ...]
}
```

### **Workflow Execution**
```python
def execute_intelligent_workflow(command, user_approved=False):
    assessment = assess_risk(command)
    
    if assessment.risk_level == RiskLevel.LOW:
        return execute_low_risk_workflow(command)
    else:
        return execute_high_risk_workflow(command, assessment, user_approved)
```

### **Safety Integration**
- **Safe Mode Integration**: Automatic Safe Mode for high-risk operations
- **Dry-Run Compatibility**: Works with existing dry-run system
- **Log Monitoring**: Integrated with MikroTik logging system
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error detection and reporting

## 📋 **Best Practices**

### **For Users:**
1. **Trust the System**: Let the AI assess risk automatically
2. **Read Warnings**: Pay attention to risk assessments and warnings
3. **Approve Carefully**: Only approve operations you understand
4. **Monitor Results**: Check the operation results and system state
5. **Use Backups**: Create backups before critical operations

### **For Operations:**
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with low-risk operations to test the system
2. **Gradual Complexity**: Progress to higher-risk operations as you gain confidence
3. **Document Changes**: Keep track of what operations you've performed
4. **Test Connectivity**: Verify network connectivity after risky operations
5. **Have Fallback**: Always have a way to access the router if something goes wrong
