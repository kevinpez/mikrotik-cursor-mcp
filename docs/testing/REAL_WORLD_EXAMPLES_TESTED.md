## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with monitoring commands before making changes
2. **Use Dry Run**: Keep `MIKROTIK_DRY_RUN=true` until confident
3. **Backup First**: Always backup before major changes
4. **Monitor Results**: Check the effects of changes immediately
5. **Document Changes**: Keep track of what you've modified

## üÜò When Things Go Wrong

### Common Recovery Steps
```
"Restore from the latest backup"
"Check system logs for errors"
"Verify network connectivity"
"Review recent configuration changes"
```

### Emergency Access
- Use direct SSH if MCP is unavailable
- Access via WinBox for GUI management
- Use serial console for complete recovery
