## ðŸš€ Key Features

### 1. Centralized Configuration
All sites defined in single `sites.yaml`:
```yaml
sites:
  site-id:
    name: "Site Name"
    host: "192.168.88.1"
    username: "admin"
    password: "secure-password"
    location: "Physical location"
    priority: "high|medium|low"
    tags: ["production", "office"]
```

### 2. Flexible Site Organization

**By Priority:**
- High, Medium, Low classification
- Critical sites get more frequent monitoring

**By Tags:**
- Tag sites: `production`, `testing`, `wifi-6`, etc.
- Execute operations on tagged groups

**By Groups:**
- Define custom groups in config
- Operate on entire groups at once

### 3. Comprehensive Health Monitoring

**System Metrics:**
- CPU load percentage
- Memory usage and availability
- System uptime
- RouterOS version

**Network Status:**
- Interface up/down count
- Active DHCP leases
- Firewall rule count
- Connection state

**Health Scoring:**
- 0-100 health score per site
- Automatic alert generation
- Threshold-based warnings

### 4. Enterprise Backup System

**Features:**
- Daily/weekly/monthly schedules
- Per-site retention policies
- Automatic cleanup of old backups
- Version history tracking
- Quick restore capabilities

**Storage:**
```
backups/
â”œâ”€â”€ home-main/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ home-main_backup_20251015_020000.rsc
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ home-main_backup_20251014_020000.rsc
â””â”€â”€ vacation-home/
    â””â”€â”€ vacation-home_backup_20251015_030000.rsc
```

### 5. Powerful Bulk Operations

- Single command across all sites
- Group-based execution
- Tag-based execution
- Priority-based execution

**Common Use Cases:**

## ðŸ“Š Sample Workflows

### Morning Health Check
```bash
# Quick overview
python site_manager.py status

# Detailed health
python site_manager.py health --all --format html --output daily_health.html

# Review alerts (sites with health < 80)
```

### Deploy Security Update
```bash
# Test on lab first
python site_manager.py bulk execute "command" --site lab-network

# Deploy to production
python site_manager.py bulk execute "command" --group production

# Verify deployment
python site_manager.py bulk execute "verify-command" --group production
```

### Add New Site
```bash
# Interactive add
python site_manager.py site add new-site

# Test connection
python site_manager.py status --site new-site

# Create initial backup
python site_manager.py backup create --site new-site
```

### Configuration Audit
```bash
# Get all firewall rules
python site_manager.py bulk execute "/ip firewall filter print" --sites all

# Get all users
python site_manager.py bulk execute "/user print" --sites all

# Compare configurations
# (Results can be diffed manually or programmatically)
```
