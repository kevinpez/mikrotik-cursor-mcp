       [3/5] remove_filter_rule                             ✓ PASS (0.31s)
       [4/5] list_nat_rules                                 ✓ PASS (0.45s)
       [5/5] get_filter_rule_status                         ✓ PASS (0.33s)

Category Summary:
  Passed:  5/5 (100.0%)
  Failed:  0
  Skipped: 0
  Duration: 1.99s
```

✅ All firewall tests passed - safe to deploy!

## Example: Debugging a Failed Command

**When something fails:**
```bash
$ python tests/hardware_validation.py -v --category Firewall

[2/5] create_filter_rule

  Executing: mikrotik_create_filter_rule
  Arguments: {'chain': 'input', 'action': 'accept', 'protocol': 'tcp', 'dst_port': '8080'}

  ✓ Command executed in 0.38s
  Result:
  Created rule ID: 15
  chain: input
  action: accept
  protocol: tcp
  dst-port: 8080

  ✓ Command successful

[3/5] remove_filter_rule

  Executing: mikrotik_remove_filter_rule
  Arguments: {'rule_id': '15'}

  ✗ Command returned error (0.31s)
  Result:
  ERROR: Rule ID 15 not found

  ✗ Command returned error
```

Now you can see:
- ✅ Rule 15 was created successfully
- ✗ But then couldn't be found/removed
- 🔍 Could be a timing issue or cleanup problem
